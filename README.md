# burstmeter-windwaker-rs

A fun little Wind Waker live memory hack that allows dpad-left to grant link forward super-speed

## How-to

Download the exe and run with Wind Waker. Note that this only works with the NA release of Wind Waker for the Gamecube.

Use `dpad-left` to active a forward burst of speed. This will cost half of a double-magic meter bar, so use it wisely!

## Download
